Your wayfinder maps as a local browser dashboard — see what needs you now, and what can run
while you're away.

## Why this fork

The lovely work here is not mine. [Mingrath Mekavichai](https://github.com/mingrath) made
wfdash, and [Matt Pocock](https://github.com/mattpocock) made the wayfinder method that
gives it maps to draw. This fork adds some custom features I needed on top of their work.

I run the dashboard as a shared web page, not as a local tool. It sits in a container behind a
Google login, and people who are not me open it. Upstream 0.1.5 is the base and stays
intact underneath. Shared use needed four things it did not have:

- **Find one map fast.** A filter box with fuzzy match, owner chips, and repo chips.
  Twenty maps across eleven repos is too many to scan by eye.
- **Sort by what matters now.** Five sorts: active, updated, tasks, afk, hitl.
- **Script it.** `/api/repos` and `/api/maps` answer as JSON from the cache the overview
  already fills. One shell line lists the maps of the repo you stand in.
- **Show a map to a non-technical reader.** `?v=simple` draws a map as a plain checklist.
  Done work is struck through. Waiting work names its blocker.

The fork derives every new field from data upstream already fetches. No new dependencies,
no build step, no LLM in the page. I want these changes to land upstream. Until they do,
the branch `overview-filter-group` is what I deploy.

## Install

**Which agent are you running?**

| | Run | You get |
|---|---|---|
| **Claude Code** | `/plugin marketplace add mingrath/wfdash`<br>`/plugin install wayfinder-tools@mingrath`<br>`/reload-plugins` | **the dashboard** — your maps as a DAG in a browser<br>**the charting rules** — injected into every `/wayfinder` session by a hook |
| **Any other agent** that reads a `SKILL.md` | `npm i -g @mingrath/wfdash`<br>`wfdash install` | **the dashboard** — as the `wfdash` command, plus a skill so your agent can run it for you<br>**the charting rules** — as a `wf-charting` skill, written into every agent on your machine that reads one |

Both channels are cut from the same tree at the same version, and the rules are the *same
file* either way, copied from one source at release, so the hook and the skill cannot drift.

`wfdash install` tells you what it wrote and what it skipped:

    wfdash 0.1.4 — installed into 2 of 3 targets

      wrote     ~/.agents/skills/wfdash/SKILL.md       Codex CLI, Cursor, Gemini CLI and 2 more
      wrote     ~/.agents/skills/wf-charting/SKILL.md  Codex CLI, Cursor, Gemini CLI and 2 more
      skipped   ~/.claude/skills/                      Claude Code — the wayfinder-tools plugin is already installed
      wrote     ~/.kiro/skills/wfdash/SKILL.md         Kiro

      not on this machine: Continue.dev, Windsurf, Qwen Code, JetBrains Junie, Trae, Kilo Code

It writes at the user level only, one file per skill, and never overwrites a skill it did
not write. Run it again after upgrading; a second run is safe and reports `unchanged`.
`--agent <name>` installs into one agent whether or not it is on this machine, and `--all`
lists the ones that are not.

**Just the charting rules, without the dashboard:**

    npx skills add mingrath/wfdash/wf-charting --global

That installs `wf-charting` into `~/.agents/skills/`, which around two dozen agents read.
Both flags are load-bearing: the subpath takes this one skill rather than both, and
`--global` writes to your home rather than into the current directory.

## Use

    wfdash                      # the overview
    wfdash owner/repo#12        # one map
    wfdash stop
    wfdash restart

A target may be written `owner/repo#N`, `owner/repo/N`, or as a GitHub issue URL. The
command prints a URL and opens a browser at it. Ask your agent "what's takeable?" and it
will do this for you.

**Where there is no browser** — a container, a cloud task, a background agent — nothing is
opened and it says so, because a silent failure here looks exactly like success:

    http://127.0.0.1:7777/m/owner/repo/12
    wfdash: no browser here (no DISPLAY or WAYLAND_DISPLAY) — nothing was opened, the URL above is yours to open.

The dashboard is running either way. `WFDASH_NO_BROWSER=1` forces it.

## What you get

- **The overview** — every map you can see, as cards, newest-edited first inside
  `takeable → stalled → uncharted → finished`. Each live card counts its open tickets by
  whether they need you — `7 hitl · 5 afk` — and its bar's green segment says whether
  anything can be started right now. A finished map says `✓ all 9 resolved`.
- **The map view** — one map as a DAG, laid out left to right by **how many rounds of
  waiting** each open ticket is from being takeable, so the first column is what you could
  start right now. Resolved tickets collapse into a block on the left. Click a ticket for its
  question, its blockers by name, and its whole comment thread.

![the map view](docs/map-view.png)

Both pages poll, so claiming a ticket in your terminal shows up without a reload.

## Requires

- **`gh` on `PATH` and authenticated** — `gh auth login`. wfdash shells out to it from the
  server, so it inherits your existing auth and no token ever reaches the browser.
- **Node 18 or newer** — ES modules and a built-in `fetch`. Zero npm dependencies and no
  build step, so there is nothing else to install.
- **An agent that loads a `SKILL.md`**, or none at all — `wfdash` is a normal command and
  works on its own from a terminal.
- **Maps to look at.** wfdash reads one convention: an issue labelled `wayfinder:map`, its
  tickets as GitHub sub-issues, blocking as native issue dependencies. It is built for maps
  charted by the `/wayfinder` skill.

## What it won't touch

- It never writes to your tracker. There are zero write endpoints.
- Nothing here forks, copies, patches, or replaces the `/wayfinder` skill itself.
- It shells out to `gh` from the server, so it inherits your existing auth and no token
  ever reaches the browser.
- It serves on `127.0.0.1:7777` and nowhere else. `WFDASH_PORT` moves it. It holds no auth,
  so reaching it from another machine is your port-forward to arrange, not a feature here.
- It reaps itself after 30 idle minutes.

## Which agents this works in

**Verified by hand, on a real machine, by watching the dashboard open:**

| Agent | Reads |
| --- | --- |
| **Codex CLI** | `~/.agents/skills/` |
| **Cursor** | `~/.agents/skills/` |

**Untested — the install path is confirmed from each vendor's own documentation, but nobody
has run wfdash there.** That is a weaker claim than the two above, and it is not a prediction
of failure:

| Reads `~/.agents/skills/` | Reads a vendor path |
| --- | --- |
| Gemini CLI, GitHub Copilot, Amp, Goose, OpenHands, opencode, Charm Crush, Zed, Warp, Cline, Augment Code, OpenClaw, Factory Droid | Claude Code `~/.claude/skills/` · Continue.dev `~/.continue/skills/` · Windsurf `~/.codeium/windsurf/skills/` · Qwen Code `~/.qwen/skills/` · Kiro `~/.kiro/skills/` · JetBrains Junie `~/.junie/skills/` · Trae `~/.trae/skills/` · Kilo Code `~/.kilo/skills/` |

Sixteen of the twenty-four read `~/.agents/skills/`, so most of the table is one directory
rather than twenty-four. Devin is the exception that cannot be reached: it loads skills from
a repository only, with no user-level path at all.

If wfdash does not appear in your agent, check its own skills list first — an agent that
fails to start looks identical, from the outside, to a skill that failed to load. If the path
in this table is wrong or has moved, that is a bug report worth filing.

## Finding your maps

The overview searches GitHub for open issues labelled `wayfinder:map` owned by whoever `gh`
is logged in as. Maps in an organisation's repos, or in repos you only collaborate on, are
not found by that search — set `WFDASH_SEARCH` to a query that reaches them:

    WFDASH_SEARCH='label:"wayfinder:map" state:open org:acme'

A search that quietly returns a subset is the one failure this cannot detect for itself, so
a short overview is worth a second look rather than a shrug.

## Updating

    npm i -g @mingrath/wfdash@latest
    wfdash install

If the command notices your installed skill is a different version from itself, it says so
in one line and carries on. Third-party Claude Code marketplaces do not auto-update either:

    /plugin marketplace update mingrath

## Contributing

Bug reports are welcome as issues. Pull requests are welcome too, but this repo is published
from another one as a squashed commit per release, so a PR cannot be merged directly — an
accepted patch is applied upstream and lands in the next release with you credited in the
commit.
