// The overview — every wayfinder map you can see, across every repo, on one screen.
//
// A card is four things: the **title** (the identifier — `raglecture` alone holds seven
// maps, so `repo #number` cannot name one), `repo #number` (the disambiguator), and one
// bottom-aligned row carrying a segmented bar and **two numbers**.
//
// **The bar carries shape, the numbers carry presence, and neither does the other's job.**
// A fixed-width bar normalises map size away and inverts the ordering it appears to give —
// a 6-takeable map drew 83px of green against a 1-takeable map's 143px. A progress
// fraction is worse: `12/14 resolved` collides on real data, putting 30% of maps in a
// colliding pair.
//
// ADR 0017 replaced ADR 0011's single `N takeable` with `N hitl · M afk`, counted over
// every live ticket rather than over the frontier. What that costs, and why it is paid, is
// under `countsHTML`.

 * with the page. What is decided here is what to draw if one arrives anyway, and only one
 * answer is consistent with the rest of this file: the three numbers must sum to the live
 * work, so every live ticket counts as `unmarked`. That is what #70's third state means, and
 * it reads as *nobody has said*, where a card printing `0 hitl · 0 afk` over 12 open tickets

 *
 * Both numbers are drawn, always. Printing one alone when the other is `0` was measured and

 * two peers. **9 of 17 live maps have a zero on one side**, so this is a main case rather
 * than a degenerate one — which is also why the zero dims instead of being drawn in its
 * side's own colour, where `0 hitl` reads as a bright zero.
 *
 * `unmarked` is a third clause and is **never folded into either side**: the numbers must
 * sum to the live work or the card is quietly wrong. It draws only when it is nonzero — 1
 * card in 25 today — and dim rather than amber, which was tried and became the brightest
 * text on the page, on the least actionable card in the corpus, colliding with `claimed` in
 * the bar. It is a footnote about data quality, not a warning.

 * live work puts a number on the card for work that cannot be started: on `webullopenapi#1`
 * and `raglecture#38` a green `3 hitl` would sit beside a bar with **no green segment at
 * all**, 4 of 25 cards. So `hitl` is white, `afk` is dim, and green stays in the bar, which
 * is now the only thing on the card that says whether anything is startable.
 *
 * Deleting the word is the deliberate half of that trade. ADR 0011 put `none takeable` into
 * words because colour could not separate a finished map from a stalled one — but those two
 * drew the same picture and these do not: finished draws `✓ all N resolved` in blue, stalled
 * draws two numbers beside a green-free bar. Keeping green *and* appending the phrase leaves
 * the contradiction standing and squeezes the bar to ~330px on the four cards least worth
 * reading.
 *
 * A blank card is rejected as before, being indistinguishable from one that failed to
 * render, and dimming a finished card is rejected on ADR 0011's own evidence — at 55%
 * opacity it collapses into the stalled group.
